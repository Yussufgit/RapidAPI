# Retrieving and Displaying Data from RapidAPI Services using JavaScript and HTML

This project demonstrates how to retrieve and display data from different RapidAPI services using JavaScript and HTML.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to sign up for a RapidAPI account and obtain an API key. You will also need a web browser and a text editor to run the code.

### Installing

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Insert your RapidAPI key in the `config.js` file where it says `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`.
4. Modify the `config.js` file to add your own API key from RapidAPI.
5. Test the code by clicking the buttons and selecting different options.

## Built With

* [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) - The web framework used to access different APIs
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - The programming language used to retrieve and display data
* [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/) - The markup language used to create the webpage layout

## Note

* The code uses Chuck Norris jokes API, Currency Exchange API, and COVID-19 API all from the RapidAPI hub.
* The script is designed to work on the client-side only and should not be used in production environments without proper security measures in place.


## Acknowledgments

* Inspiration for this project came from the need to retrieve and display data from different RapidAPI services
